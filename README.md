# How-to-Measure-Height-Width-Area-Values-of-Bottle-Using-With-OpenCV-Python
Measurement of height, width and area of ​​bottles using real-time video capture using Raspberry Pi 4 and Raspi v2 Camera.
We worked on Autonomous Bottle Sorter Project with a team. 
I was responsible for distinguishing plastic and can bottles using image processing.
The python code in the Image_Processing folder detects the boundaries of the bottles using real-time video capture and outputs the size values ​​in pixels.
# Explanation of Outputs
First column --> Bottle is plastic or can

Second column --> Height of the bottle

Third column --> Width of the bottle

Fourth column --> Area of the bottle

Example of our outputs;
